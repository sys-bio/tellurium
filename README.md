## Introduction

Tellurium is a python environment for reproducible dynamical modeling of biological networks. 
Tellurium provides the interfacial code to convert between standard formats and utilize powerful 
libraries without requiring technical expertise, allowing you to focus on what’s important: 
building better models. Tellurium also provides first-class support for exchangeability via 
[COMBINE archives](http://co.mbine.org/documents/archive), allowing you to share your models 
and simulations with other tools.

Tellurium combines state-of-the-art scientific Python libraries, such 
as [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/), 
and includes special-purpose systems biology Python tools. Out of the box, 
Tellurium includes [libroadrunner](https://github.com/sys-bio/roadrunner), 
[antimony](http://antimony.sourceforge.net/), [phrasedml](http://phrasedml.sf.net/), 
[libsbml](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML), and [libsedml](https://github.com/fbergmann/libSEDML).

The Tellurium (and libroadrunner project) project is funded from the NIH/NIGMS (GM081070) and NIH/NIBIB U24EB028887.

## Installation Instructions

:exclamation:**Attention to those using Python 2.7 :**
**[Python 2.7 reached EOL on January 1st, 2020](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/). Support for Python 2.7 has been dropped, though previous releases will continue to be available.**

Tellurium can be installed as a Python package, with a front-end (Notebook, IDE), or in a cloud environment (Google Colab):

A. [Python package (pip)](#install-via-pip-no-front-end)  
B. [IDE front-end](#front-end-1-spyder-for-tellurium-ide) based on [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)  
C. [Notebook front-end](#front-end-2-tellurium-notebook)  
D. [Google Colab](#google-colab)  

We recommend first-time users choose one of the front-ends, while developers looking to integrate Tellurium use the pip package. All python desktop IDE graphical front-ends should work. We know for certain that telluirum will work from Spyder, pyCharm and Visual Studio Code.

The IDE front-end provides a MATLAB like experience with a code editor and Python console. 
The notebook front-end provides a notebook interface similar to [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/), 
and features notebook cells for inline OMEX, a human-readable representation of COMBINE archives.

For any issues with installation and setup, please check [FAQ](https://github.com/sys-bio/tellurium/wiki/FAQ) or [contact us](#contact-us). 

-------

### Install via pip
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/tellurium.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/tellurium)

If you have a version of Python in an environment you're comfortable with, you can add Tellurium with pip:

```
pip install tellurium
```	

Tellurium itself is Python-only, and is available for any version of Python 3.  Its main binary dependency, roadrunner, should be installed with Tellurium, and should be available for the latest three or four versions of Python (currently 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11), for Windows, Mac (both Intel and ARM), and Linux. 

For those using Anaconda, we currently do not have a separate Anaconda version of Tellurium, so you'll need to install it via pip, as above.

:exclamation:**For detailed instructions on how to setup Tellurium on Anaconda distributions, 
see [this page](https://github.com/sys-bio/tellurium/wiki/FAQ#i-would-like-to-use-tellurium-on-anaconda-what-should-i-do).** 


For developers, the latest stable version from the repository can be installed via
```
pip install git+https://github.com/sys-bio/tellurium.git
```

### Front-end 1: Spyder for Tellurium IDE
The Tellurium Spyder installers are tested with Windows 10 and 11, and come with a choice of Python versions.

**For those who wish to use Tellurium with Spyder IDE on Mac OS X or Linux, we suggest you to install through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) by 
following the instructions on [this page](https://github.com/sys-bio/tellurium/wiki/FAQ#i-would-like-to-use-tellurium-on-anaconda-what-should-i-do).**

<img align="left" width="32px" id="mac-osx" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/sys-bio/tellurium/img/macos.png">
<h4>Mac OS X</h4>
<br style="clear:both"/>

For Mac users ther a a number of options. By far the easiest is to use the self-cotbained Thonny Python IDE.

### Thonny IDE for Python
Tellurium can be used with [Thonny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thonny), a free, open-source IDE for Python that is designed for beginners.

<img align="left" width="32px" id="windows" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/sys-bio/tellurium/img/windows.png">
<h4>Windows</h4>
<br style="clear:both"/>

1. [Download the latest version of Thonny for Windows](https://thonny.org)
2. Double-click the installer `*.exe` to start the installation
3. Follow the instructions
4. Launch Thonny
5. Go to Tools > Manage packages...
6. Type `tellurium` in the search box and press the "Search on PyPI" button
7. Once the `tellurium` package is found in "Search results", click on it, and then press the "Install" button. Wait until the installation process is completed.


<img align="left" width="32px" id="mac-osx" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/sys-bio/tellurium/img/macos.png">
<h4>Mac OS X</h4>
<br style="clear:both"/>

1. [Download the latest version of Thonny for Mac OS X](https://thonny.org)
2. Double-click the installer `*.pkg` to start the installation
3. Follow the instructions
4. Launch Thonny from Spotlight or directly from your Applications folder
5. Go to Tools > Manage packages...
6. Type `tellurium` in the search box and press the "Search on PyPI" button
7. Once the `tellurium` package is found in "Search results", click on it, and then press the "Install" button. Wait until the installation process is completed.




and the Spyder IDE through Anaconda:

1. [Download the Anaconda distribution for Mac OS X.](https://www.anaconda.com/download). 

2. [Follow the installer instructions.](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux). The installer will install Spyder as part of the installation process. If you customize the installation, you will have a chance to select which packages to install - ensure Spyder is selected.
3. When prompted, add Anaconda to your PATH (optional, but this will make the following steps easier).
4. [Open a Terminal](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Terminal-Window-in-Mac) and run the command:
```
conda install msgpack-python
```
Next, install Tellurium itself:
```
pip install tellurium
```
If this fails, try using the default absolute path to Anaconda, which will probably be something like:
```
/Users/<your-user>/opt/anaconda3/bin/pip install tellurium
```
5. Launch the Anaconda Navigator via Launchpad. In Anaconda Navigator, run Spyder and then try `import tellurium` within the Spyder editor or console.

:question:Looking for old releases? [You can find them here.](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pytellurium/files/notebook) To install an old release over a new release, you will need to [manually wipe the data directory.](https://github.com/sys-bio/tellurium/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-uninstall-tellurium-notebook)

<br>

-------

### Google Colab
Tellurium can be used entirely in a browser using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  Ideally, it will work with the following steps (updated May 2023)
  
1. run a cell with ```!apt-get install libncurses5```
2. run a cell with ```!pip install -q tellurium==2.2.8```
3. (Very important) Restart the runtime (From the menu: 'Runtime / Restart runtime')
4. Test by typing ```import tellurium as te```
  
The Python version behind Colab changes periodically, so what worked one day may stop working the next, but the following Colab notebook worked when used at ICSB 2022:  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wddLftHNhetbozZY29r2HRkzQLl1F_fs#scrollTo=l1bCgW46-adR and will hopefully be instructive.
